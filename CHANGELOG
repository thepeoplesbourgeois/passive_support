## v 0.8.3

### New Features

- A changelog!
- `Ps.Utils` module
  - Includes an interface to `Ps.Logging` in case you don't feel like typing
    the extra 2 characters
    - Me.
    - Also, hitting the "L" is so much more effort than hitting "U". I mean,
      you have to remember that your ring finger is right there on the L when
      resting on the home row keys, and ain't nobody (Me.) got time for that.
  - `env/0` returns which environment your app was compiled in (with a caveat.
    See its documentation)
  - The `prytask/0` macro invokes `IEx.pry/0`, in the context where it's called,
    without blocking the process it's called from. Perfect for inspecting the
    `conn` or `socket` without causing a request timeout. And probably for other
    things, too!

### Fixes

- `Ps.Atom.from_string/1` will pass atoms through unaltered
- The `Ps.Blank` protocol now properly detects blank/present `MapSet`s
- `Ps.FormData.parse_form_data/1` is renamed to `Ps.FormData.form_encoded/1`
  to be more logically accurate, given what it does, which is not to parse a
  form's data, but in fact, to convert an Elixir data structure _to_ form data
