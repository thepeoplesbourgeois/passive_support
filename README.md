# PassiveSupport

**Helpful functions for handling data in Elixir, inspired by the Ruby library ActiveSupport**

## Installation

add the following line to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
  {:passive_support, git: "git://github.com/thepeoplesbourgeois/passive_support"},
```

You're probably gonna want to pin it to a specific `:ref`. I mean, I would.
